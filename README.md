  Project Overview
The goal of the FaultFindy system is to identify faulty tyres from a set of images taken from a manufacturing line. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the EfficientNetB4 pre-trained model, the system classifies tyre images as either Good or Defective. The model is trained on a balanced dataset, with an accuracy of 95% after fine-tuning.

Installation Instructions
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/FaultFindy.git
cd FaultFindy

2. Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv

Dataset Structure:
/defective
/good
You can also modify the paths in the code to suit your environment.

Dataset
The dataset consists of images of Defective and Good tyres. The images are classified into two categories:

Defective Tyres (Class 0)
Good Tyres (Class 1)
The dataset was split into training and validation subsets with a ratio of 87.5% for training and 12.5% for validation.

Model Training
The project uses the EfficientNetB4 model, which is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, and fine-tunes it for the tyre defect classification task. The training process includes image augmentation, optimization with the Nadam optimizer, and binary cross-entropy loss for classification.

Data preprocessing involves resizing the images to 224x224 pixels, normalizing the pixel values, and augmenting the dataset.
The model was first trained with frozen base layers, followed by fine-tuning the last layers for better accuracy.
Evaluation and Results
Initial Model Accuracy: 90%
After Fine-Tuning Accuracy: 95%
The model was evaluated on the validation set, achieving a high accuracy of 95% in predicting whether a tyre is Good or Defective.


Future Work
Further Model Optimization: Experiment with different architectures like ResNet and Inception.
Data Augmentation: Increase the dataset size using synthetic data generation techniques.
Real-Time Integration: Implement the system for real-time classification in the manufacturing line.
